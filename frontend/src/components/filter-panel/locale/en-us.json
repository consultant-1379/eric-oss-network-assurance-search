To create a Context Filter, select the 'Add' button. Using these filters focuses the measurement results on the entities and metrics that you are interested in monitoring. You can apply multiple Context Filters simultaneously. When you apply multiple Context Filters, the results displayed in the table will reflect matches to the value criteria of all applied filters. \n\nFor example, if there is one filter for Column A for '12*' and another filter for Column A for 'Doesn't match 123', the results in the table should be all the results for Column A where the values start with 12, excluding the results for Column A where the value is 123.",

Measurement filters are meant to help you configure filters that enable you to capture the status of your SLAs.",
